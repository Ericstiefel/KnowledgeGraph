These prompts are the same ones utilized in the KGGen paper, utilizing few-shot 
prompting to obtain more accurate results, especially the lightweight llama model I used 
due to compute boundaries, tinyllama.


PROMPTS FOR KG-EXTRACTION 


Prompt for extracting entities: 

Extract key entities from the given
text. Extracted entities are nouns, verbs, or adjectives,
particularly regarding sentiment. This is for an extraction
task, please be thorough and accurate to the reference text.


Prompt for extracting relations: 

Extract subject-predicate-object
triples from the assistant message. A predicate (1
word) defines the relationship between the subject and
object. Relationship may be fact or sentiment based on
assistant’s message. Subject and object are entities.
Entities provided are from the assistant message and
prior conversation history, though you may not need all of
them. This is for an extraction task, please be thorough,
accurate, and faithful to the reference text.


Prompt for clustering entities:

Find ONE cluster of related entities from this list. A
cluster should contain entities that are the same in
meaning, with different:
- tenses
- plural forms
- stem forms
- upper/lower cases
Or entities with close semantic meanings.
Return only if you find entities that clearly belong
together.
If you can’t find a clear cluster, return an empty list.


Prompt for validating node clusters:

Verify if these entities belong in the same cluster.
A cluster should contain entities that are the same in
meaning, with different:
- tenses
- plural forms
- stem forms
- upper/lower cases
Or entities with close semantic meanings.
Return the entities that you are confident belong together
as a single cluster.
If you’re not confident, return an empty list.
Prompt for clustering edges
Find ONE cluster of closely related predicates from this
list.
A cluster should contain predicates that are the same in
meaning, with different:
- tenses
- plural forms
- stem forms
- upper/lower cases
Predicates are the relations between subject and object
entities. Ensure that the predicates in the same cluster
have very close semantic meanings to describe the relation
between the same subject and object entities.
Return only if you find predicates that clearly belong
together.
If you can’t find a clear cluster, return an empty list.


Prompt for validating cluster edges:

Verify if these predicates belong in the same cluster.
A cluster should contain predicates that are the same in
meaning, with different:
- tenses
- plural forms
- stem forms
- upper/lower cases
Predicates are the relations between subject and object
entities. Ensure that the predicates in the same cluster
have very close semantic meanings to describe the relation
between the same subject and object entities.
Return the predicates that you are confident belong together
as a single cluster.
If you’re not confident, return an empty list.

VALIDATION OF KG EXTRACTION


Prompt for extracting entities: 

Extract key entities from the given
text. Extracted entities are nouns, verbs, or adjectives,
particularly regarding sentiment. This is for an extraction
task, please be thorough and accurate to the reference text.
Prompt for extracting relations: Extract subject-predicate-object
triples from the assistant message. A predicate (1-3
words) defines the relationship between the subject and
object. Relationship may be fact or sentiment based on
assistant’s message. Subject and object are entities.
Entities provided are from the assistant message and
prior conversation history, though you may not need all of
them. This is for an extraction task, please be thorough,
accurate, and faithful to the reference text.


PROMPTS FOR MINE


Prompt for extracting a fact from article: 

Extract 15 basic, single
pieces of information from the following text that describe
how one object relates to another. Present the pieces of
info in short sentences and DO NOT include info not directly
present in the text. Your output should be of the form [
"info1", "info2" ,..., "info15" ]. "Make sure the strings
are valid Python strings."


Prompt for evaluating if a fact is contained in the query result:

ROLE: "You are an evaluator that checks if the correct
answer can be deduced from the information in the context.
TASK: Determine whether the context contains the information
stated in the correct answer.
Respond with "1" if yes, and "0" if no. Do not provide any
explanation, just the number.
